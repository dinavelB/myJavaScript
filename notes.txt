JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
   
    All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable. 
   
    function substitute () {var myValue = document.getElementByldQ.value;}
           - function name is substitute
           - variable name is myValue
